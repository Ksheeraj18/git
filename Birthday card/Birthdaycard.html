    <h2>🌸 Birth and Origin of Lord Krishnaa </h2><br>
    Lord Krishnaa, the eighth incarnation of Lord Vishnu, was born during the Dvapara Yuga, on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the dark half of the month <b>Shraavana (July–August)</b>, a day now celebrated as <b>Krishna Janmashtami</b>. His birthplace was the sacred city of Mathura, the capital of the <b>Shurasena Kingdom</b>, ruled by the cruel <b>King Kamsa</b>. Mathura was a city of spiritual significance and ancient history. Lord Krishnaa was born as a divine blessing to Devaki and Vasudeva, following divine prophecy and intervention.

He was a mischievous child, a beloved friend, a wise guide, and an invincible protector.

His heroism was in both might and mind, and his counsel remains a cornerstone of spiritual and philosophical thought.<br>

    <h2>👑 The Divine King and Friend</h2>
    As the prince of Dwarka, Krishnaa established a prosperous and just kingdom. He stood by truth and protected the weak. He was a dear friend to the Pandavas, a wise diplomat who diffused conflicts, and a divine soul who never sought personal glory. Krishnaa valued love over power, wisdom over wealth, and truth over alliances. His divine presence ensured peace, growth, and spiritual elevation in every place he resided.<br>
